        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <b>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</b>
        <p>
            I wanted something that wasn't too confusing to build. I tweaked my original idea and built out a wireframe,
            based on a different website.
        </p>
        <b>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</b>
        <p>
            We communicated over email. There wasn't much to communicate about, but I did manage to send my wireframe to
            the wrong person, so that didn't help.
        </p>
        <b>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</b>
        <p>
            Doesn't look like their junior devs did anything. The homepage looks good though! The only issues are my
            fault, the svg didn't scale like I expected it to.
        </p>
        <b>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</b>
        <p>
            I'll check up more often.
        </p>

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <b>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</b>
        <p>
            I made GitHub Issues and assigned them to people. I don't think that worked, I should've used more direct
            communication alongside it, like email.
        </p>
        <b>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</b>
        <p>
            We communicated over email and occasionally in class. It was pretty smooth, and he came up with what I
            needed soon after I asked him for it. I got mixed up since he's my senior for another project, but it worked
            out.
        </p>
        <b>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</b>
        <p>
            I used GitHub pages and shared the published link with them.
        </p>
        <b>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</b>
        <p>
            It was pretty good. I'm used to using Git, so it worked pretty naturally. No merge conflicts that I know of.
        </p>

        <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <b>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</b>
        <p>
            I talked with them in person to get my tasks, and sent emails when I needed more info. It worked well.
        </p>
        <b>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</b>
        <p>
            Not at first, but we cleared it up pretty quick.
        </p>
        <b>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</b>
        <p>
            Yes.
        </p>
        <b>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</b>
        <p>
            Nope!
        </p>

        <h2>General Experience and Reflection</h2>
        <b>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</b>
        <p>
            The hardest part was working with unclear or missing information. It was easy to overcome with Flannery, he
            supplied info when I asked. For Tuft, I kinda just did my best. No issues with Bentley.
        </p>
        <b>What did you enjoy most about this project?</b>
        <p>
            It was nice to not have to worry about making things look nice after I did the wireframe. I just needed to
            copy what I was given. That probably would get boring fast though.
        </p>
        <b>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</b>
        <p>
            I'd probably make sure I communicate with my juniors better. I kinda just assumed they'd figure it out based
            on the issues I assigned, and they'd ask me otherwise. That's an oops on my part.
        </p>
        <b>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</b>
        <p>
            A little bit. I know a bit more about how working on different timelines works, and what to look out for
            when dealing with clients. Nobody got mad since it's a school class, but I imagine there would be problems
            in the real world.
